// We just discovered a new data structure in our research group: a suffix three!

// It's very useful for natural language processing. Given three languages and three suffixes, a suffix three can determine which language a sentence is written in.

// It's super simple, 100% accurate, and doesn't involve advanced machine learning algorithms.

// Let us tell you how it works.

// If a sentence ends with "po" the language is Filipino.
// If a sentence ends with "desu" or "masu" the language is Japanese.
// If a sentence ends with "mnida" the language is Korean.
// Given this, we need you to implement a suffix three that can differentiate Filipino, Japanese, and Korean.

// Oh, did I say three suffixes? I meant four.
